## Hello, Welcome to Disaster Drone

The mission is to create a drone that will take photos of a distater site and upload all those images to the cloud. Once on 
the cloud the images will then be process with a photogrammetry software. Then the 3D model/object will be rendered into a virutal reality
enviorment, where the user can walk around and pin point specific locations of the model which would the individual damage locations. After
the user exits the program the the pin point spots will be uploaded as images to a website that can then combine all the images into a document
so they user can file an insurance claim.
